A new preprint is out. I discuss the coordination control of multi-eVTOL fleet in an AAM environment through the lens of partially observable stochastic games (POSG).  A novel heterogeneous graph attention encoder-decoder is proposed for solving the POSG through multi-agent reinforcement learning [<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07337.pdf'>Preprint</a>]
