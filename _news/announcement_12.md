Excited to announce that I have been awarded the Digital Futures Postdoctoral Fellowship by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology ($200,000/SKR 2,000,000) for my proposal "Communication and Energy-Aware Autonomy for Collaborative Aerial Swarms" after a competitive evaluation round. This will allow me to continue research in the beautiful Swedish campus for two years!  I am looking forward to establish new collaborations in multi-objective RL, autonomous driving, and aerial fleet control.
