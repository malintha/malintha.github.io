    - Dimensionality reduction
    - Clustering
    - Bayesian classification
    - Undirected graphical models (Markov random fields, variational inference, Mean-field approximation)
    - Nonlinear methods (spectral clustering, kernel methods)
    - Neural networks
    - Hidden Markov models
    - Support vector machines
    - Probabilistic topic modelling
    - Adaptive methods


- Signal processing topics
    - Fourier transformation
    - Audio denoising
