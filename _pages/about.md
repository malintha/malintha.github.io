The interest on collaborative multi-robot systems are at an all time high thanks to the advances in autonomous mobility, and human-in-the-loop systems. A constellation of reasons may contribute to the heterogeneity of such systems: 1) <b> physical traits </b> such as range, variety of capabilities, sensors; and 2) <b>self-interest </b> due to their ownership. My research revolves around the question: <b>How can we control such diverse <i>systems</i> to achieve group objectives? </b>
<!-- The applications of my research include autonomous mobility, human-swarm systems that can assist disaster-rescue and first-responder teams. -->
