<b>Hello!</b>
I am a PhD student working in multi-robot systems and unmanned aerial vehicles. 
My research insterests include autonomous mobility, multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning. The applications of my research include, (but not limited to) advanced air mobility, mobile wireless networks, robot formation control. 

My research revolves around the question: <b>How can we coordinate connected, heterogeneous robot fleets to achieve group objectives in a scalable and a cooperative manner? </b>

<br>
<b>Cover image story:</b> A <i>Starling</i> murmuration over a lake, which incidently looked liked a giant bird. Starlings (among many other animals) can coordinate their flights in thousands strong swarms in harmoneous, cohesive motions; which I think characterizes an ideal <i>swarm</i>. Checkout the demo video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVkNUKgViSg"> here</a>, where I aimed to replicate the flocking behaviour with drones.
