I am currently a full-time visiting faculty with the department of Intelligent Systems Engineering of Indiana University. I teach the <b>Machine Learning for Signal Processing (ENGR-E511)</b> class in this Spring. My research focuses on designing decentralized autonomy for <b>intereacting dynamical systems <i>or systems of systems</i> to act as a <i>cohesive</i> under stochastic observations and communication. </b> 
<!-- The applications of my research include autonomous mobility, human-swarm systems that can assist disaster-rescue and first-responder teams. -->
