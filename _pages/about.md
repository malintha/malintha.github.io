Hello! 
I am a PhD student researching in multi-robot systems. 
My research insterests include aerial robot teams, multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning. The applications of my research include, (but not limited to) advanced air mobility, mobile wireless networks, robot formation control etc. 

My research revolves around the question: <b>How can we coordinate connected, heterogeneous robot fleets to achieve group objectives in a scalable and a cooperative manner? </b>
